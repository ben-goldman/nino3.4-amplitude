#+TITLE: Notes for Paper

* Introduction
** Greenhouse emissions are increasing global temperatures (breifly state)
** ENSO is a change in the temperature of the pacific ocean with effects around the world
** If climate change affects ENSO, then we need to find out _now_
** Climate change affects ENSO
*** Comparison of amplitude between many models with CMIP5 is mostly inconclusive
*** CESM-LE shows increase in amplitude that is significant
** Role of multiple natural and artificial factors
*** Greenhouse gasses may be increasing ENSO amplitude
*** aerosol emissions dampen GHG increase in amplitude
*** What about everything else?
*** Not using a large ensemble mostly
** Gap: not enough analysis on how ghg and aer affect ENSO amplitude
*** how the two factors interact
*** how their effects look compared to internal variability
*** What physical mechanisms mediate their effect
