* Introduction
** Rationale
*** Greenhouse emissions are increasing global temperatures (breifly state)
*** ENSO is a change in the temperature of the pacific ocean with effects around the world
*** If climate change affects ENSO, then we need to find out _now_
** Review of literature:
*** Climate change affects ENSO
**** Comparison of amplitude between many models with CMIP5 is mostly inconclusive
**** CESM-LE shows increase in amplitude that is significant
*** Role of multiple natural and artificial factors
**** Greenhouse gasses may be increasing ENSO amplitude
**** aerosol emissions dampen GHG increase in amplitude
**** What about everything else?
**** Not using a large ensemble mostly
** Gap
*** not enough analysis on how ghg, aer, and others affect ENSO amplitude
**** how the two factors interact
**** how their effects look compared to internal variability
**** What physical mechanisms mediate their effect
*** Use some interesting methods: wavelet analysis
** Variables:
*** Independent variable: external forcing
**** input climate models with observed and predicted greenhouse gas, aerosol, biomass burning, land use/cover, etc
**** GHG:
***** Observed and predicted to increase due to industrial burning
***** Lead to higher air (and water) temperature due to greenhouse effect
**** AER:
***** Aerosols produced by industry (smoke) and nature (volcanoes)
***** Usually reduce global temperatures by reflecting oncoming sunlight
***** Location of emission may change as industry moves from US to China
**** BMB:
***** Increased frequency of forest and grassland fires probably due to global warming
***** Releases CO_{2} (GHG) and smoke (AER)
**** LULC:
***** Deforestation and desertification
***** Greenery reduces land temperature
***** Greenery reduces CO_{2} levels
***** Modifies water cycle as leaves increase evaporation
* Data
** CESM1
*** Full forcing
**** Observed emissions levels 1920-2005
**** RCP8.5 (worst case) emissions levels 2005-2100
*** Single forcing
**** All but one forcing group
***** GHG
***** AER
***** BMB
***** LULC
**** Observed 1920-2005
**** Predicted emissions 2005-2080
*** Control
**** 1850 fixed emissions levels
** CESM2
*** Higher ensemble size
*** Longer record length
*** Newer code
*** Full forcing
**** SMBB vs CMIP6 discrepancy
**** Observed forcing levels 1850-2005
**** Worst case emissions 2006-2100
*** Single Forcing
**** Similar to CESM1
**** Not all members are done yet
*** Control
**** Similar to CESM1
** Observed data
*** Might mention in introduction?
*** Used for introductory presentation figures, not yet for actual methods
* Methods and Results
** For all ensembles and all variables:
*** Subtract ensemble mean from each member to derive internal variability i.e. ENSO
** Niño 3.4 index
*** Mean temperature in Niño 3.4 region
*** 20-year rolling variance for each member
*** Ensemble statistics: mean and standard error (dependent on ensemble size)
*** Control?
*** Figure 1: CESM1 and CESM2 FF Niño 3.4 variance ensemble means
*** Explanation:
**** CESM1
***** Starts with low variance, steeply increasing from 1950-2050, dropping slightly after 2050
***** Probably nonlinear response to forcing: does not keep increasing
****** Are emissions slowing down post-2050?
**** CESM2
***** Exponential? increase in variance until 2025, then sharp decrease
****** Why?
** Single forcing ensembles
*** SF ensembles for CESM1 and CESM2
*** All-but one
**** Figure 2: ENSO amplitude index for SF and FF models
**** Explanation
***** -BMB and -LULC means are pretty close to FF mean, signaling little impact
***** -AER and -GHG means are mostly unchanged, signaling stronger impact
*** Bootstrap
**** Subtract random SF member from random FF member
**** Leaves behind isolated effect of single factor
