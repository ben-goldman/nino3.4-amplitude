1. Introduction
    1. Already written
2. Materials/data
    1. CESM LE setup
        3. adds stastical robustness
        4. Differing initial conditions, same physics
        5. Single forcing ensembles
        6. PI control run
3. Methods / Results
    1. Nino 3.4 20-year variance
        1. Increase and then decrease in 21st century in full forcing ensemble
        2. Is it statistically significant?
        3. Low variance in mid-20th century
    2. Bootstrap difference between sf and ff
        1. Random member of sf ensemble - random member of ff ensemble x1000
        2. Both GHG and AER show increase compared to full forcing
        3. Additivity
            4. Added SF differences and compared to ff run
            5. Not equal
    3. Test AMO/AMOC in control for influence on Nino 3.4 20 year variance
        1. No systematic difference between ENSO in high AMO or AMOC and low.
        2. Internal variabiity is important, but which one?
            1. Need to test more modes of variability (PDO, TPDV, more)
            2. Does internal variabilty account for low variance ~1940's
    4. Correlation coefficient between ocean temp and Nino variance
        1. Correlation between temperature and Nino 3.4 variance at each grid-point, both are detrended linearly and smoothed with a 30-year running mean
        2. Increased stratification in pacific
5. Conclusions/discussion
