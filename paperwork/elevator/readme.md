# Elevator Speech

Hello, my name is Ben Goldman. Have you ever experienced an unusually hot summer or heard about extreme weather in the news? More often than not these kinds of events are caused by El Nino, arguably the most influential element of the climate system. In short, El Nino is governed by how water temperature in the tropical Pacific ocean interacts with air circulation. However, scientists are not sure how El Nino will change in the future due to global warming. The goal of my project was to determine what these changes are predicted to be, and why they happen. My methodology involves using datasets of sea surface temperature from climate models that predict how things will change under global warming. By measuring intensity of El Niño in the model set's output, I have predicted an increase in el Niño strength in the mid-21st century, meaning that El Niño could be stronger in the future. Thank you for listening.
