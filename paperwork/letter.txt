Dear Incoming Sophomore,

Hello! I'm so excited you've chosen to join the science research program! I'm just writing to give you an idea of what you have to look forward to during the next few years and give you some advice for succeeding in the science research program. This class is tough mostly because you really need to manage your time. Luckily this is pretty easy because the teacher gives us a system to stay organized, and like we all lose track every once in a while, which is totally fine. We have a really laid-back classroom atmosphere because most of the time there isn't really a lesson, its just us working independently or collaborating to prepare our studies. There are times when this class can be a bit stressful, like when we have to prepare presentations, but over time you will become more comfortable talking about your research and presentations will get easier and easier. You don't need to know right away what you want to do your project on, and you will have plenty of time to narrow down your study's goals and questions. A really big part of your sophomore year here will be searching for a mentor, who will guide you in preparing and conducting your experiment. Over the years my mentor and I have become pretty close, and he wrote a letter of reccomendation for college. The teacher will explain how to get a mentor, but it basically requires emailing a bunch of researchers. Speaking of college, a big perk of this program is that it allows you to earn college credits while still in high school. This will save you tons of money, as well as look really good on applications. This class will help you to accomplish so many cool things and also provide a supportive and fun community. Good luck these next few years!
Sincerely,
Ben
