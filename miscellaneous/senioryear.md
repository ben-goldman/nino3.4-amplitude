# Plans for Senior Year

## Add to study

- New variables/methods
  - Correlation coefficient with other modes of internal variability
  - EOF-based definition of ENSO
  - Analyze air currents
  - Changes to seasonal cycle under global warming
  - Look at observed record of ENSO intensity
  - Use CESM2 and CMIP6 ensembles data
- Schematic diagram for how global warming affects ENSO
- Change all data analysis to using R
- Machine learning for predicting ENSO? (Maybe, slightly unrelated)

I may be attending a family event in Boulder CO the coming September; maybe I could use that as an opportunity to meet up with my mentor?

- Finalize paper
- Get paper reviewed and publish it in journal (mentor will help).
- Present at JSHS
- Add all new data to presentation
