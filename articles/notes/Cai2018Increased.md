# Notes for _Increased variability of eastern Pacific El Niño under greenhouse warming_

## Introduction

- EP (Eastern Pacific) ENSO is the most damaging, so predicting the impact of climate change on it is very important
- Global warming is modifying the structure/dynamics of the Pacific ocean, leading to increased rainfall variability, but impact on ENSO is not clear
- Models are having trouble agreeing on the impact of climate change on EP ENSO variability because the major method of measuring EP ENSO (Nino3 index) is not applicable to all models in the same way
- This study shows that EP ENSO variability is predicted to increase, and that Nino3 index is ineffective for measuring EP variability

## Distinguishing SST Anomaly Centers

- Ran EOF analysis on observed SST records, used the first 2 principal components to represent CP and EP ENSO index
- Quadratic relationship between representations of EP and CP ENSO
- Generated indices representing strength of EP and CP ENSO
- EP is skewed toward El Niño, CP is skewed toward La Niña.

## Nonlinear Dynamics Generate Skewness

- Skewness of C-index represents CP ENSO favoring La Nina
- Opposite with E-index
- Calculated spacial pattern of C-index and E-index
- Examined changes to ocean dynamics using pattern

## Skewness Determines the Anomaly Center

- Applied previous process to CMIP5 models
- EP anomaly center varies greatly between models.

## Variability Increases at the EP-ENSO Center

## Stratification Change Boosts Dynamic Coupling

## Conclusion
