- Used SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) together with the Mixed Layer Heat Budget Analysis to look at which feedbacks contributed most to ENSO's variation between models
- Influence of thermocline feedback is determined by how strongly equatorial horizontal winds affect the slope of the thermocline.

- BJ index overestimates the importance of the Thermocline feedback.
- BJ index assumes that terms should be linear when combined, but they actually aren't.

- Nonlinear differential equations have solutions that must be solved numerically
- When graphed in phase space, these solutions form attractors that never repeat themselves
- Many natural phenomena, including weather, are chaotic
- Accurate long-term weather prediction is likely impossible

- Change in ENSO characteristics after 2000
- Lower thermocline slope reduces TH feedback, making it harder for strong ENSO to form

- Use two different large ensembles
- ENSO has lots of internal variability in models
- 30-40 members of an ensemble are needed to detect significant changes to ENSO in the ensemble mean
- Increase in ENSO amplitude in worst case (RCP8.5) scenario

- How to use wavelets to estimate power spectrum in timeseries.
- Uses ENSO data /very niiceee/
- Windowed Fourier Transform sucks butt because it is dependent on a time step parameter that can muck with the results depending on which value you choose.
- A wavelet is a short */blirp/* of a wave with a mean of zero and finite amplitude/frequency and limited time domain.
- To get an ex. Morlet Wavelet take a regular wave and multiply it by a Gaussian (normal bell curve) so that it drops off over time.
- Will be using continuous methods, but discrete also works.
- Use mathematical transforms to vary scale and translation of wavelet as it slides across the time series.
- Integrate wavelet multiplied by the timeseries while varying scale and shift to generate a power spectrum.
- Applied wavelet spectrum analysis to Nino 3 timeseries
- strong variance in 2-8 year frequency area, but with slight changes between 1900 and 1990
- However, results are highly dependent on which mother wavelet you choose because they all have quite different properties.
- Trying power spectrum from a DOG (Mexican Hat) wavelet gives overall similar answer as Morelett wavelet, but it is slightly different (more detailed in time, less detailed in frequency.)
- Use formula to pick scale limits
- Add zeroes around the timeseries so that the wavelet equation does not misunderstand the data by thinking it is cyclical
- Create a cone of influence to mark where the edge confusion is able to interfere with the results.
- Make sure you convert between the wavelet scale to the Fourier period when you make your axes
- You can also reverse the wavelet transform to get back the timeseries from the power chart if you really want to (I dont think I will).
- Time for significance analysis!
- take a background spectrum that serves as the null hypothesis: all spikes in the power spectrum are due to chance, the underlying signal is really random.
- Comparing to red noise shows that the peaks of ENSO in 2-8 years are statistically significant
- Calculate 95% confidence interval by taking 95% confidence $\chi^2$ statistic and multiplying by red noise spectrum.
- Nino3 SST wavelet power from 2-8year frequency is sometimes significantly different from red noise expectations.
- "The confidence interval is defined as the probability that the true wavelet power at a certain time and scale lies within a certain interval about the estimated wavelet power."
- $\chi^2$ test is advantageous because it applies to a lot of situations in wavelet analysis.
- Averaging the wavelet spectrum across the whole time range gives the overall power spectrum which can be significance tested and approximates the Fourier spectrum.
- Smoothing/averaging increases DOF, allowing to greater significance for the peaks
- After that, only main ENSO frequency band is shown to be statistically significant.
- Similar to time averaging, scale averaging is sometimes a good idea
- Wavelet analysis can be used to denoise an image/timeseries by throwing away the zones who's amplitude does not meet a certain level of significance.
- Wavelet analysis across spatial and temporal domains when squashed by frequency allows for a great analysis of spatial and temporal variability.
