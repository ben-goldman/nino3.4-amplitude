- lots of arm waving. SOOOOMUCH ARM WAVING!!! And very little breathing
- make a list of “overhead” - make sure all concepts are well defined, in your notes, possibly in your slides
- summary of what your many slides are — many different crunching of different data to circle around a process that we’re trying to under
- insert heading slides, overall need a good deal more organization.
- slide 1: break up into two or even 3?
- Slide 2: Need to explain more generally what’s in the figure
- Slide 3: climate simulation — is this method? If so, say so
- Slide 4: ENSO and climate change slide — have “literature review” in heading.
- slide about Mentor: do a better job explaining the interactive process between you and your mentor.
- 3.4 index - whahah? I didn’t follow
- Single forcing ensembles slide — not sure if all those arrows are working for you. Skip over single forcing setup, maybe?
- use consistent language about the aerosols and their influence, considering that it’s a prediction
