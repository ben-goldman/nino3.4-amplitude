\subsection*{Feedback}
\label{sec:org1d74604}
\begin{itemize}
\item lots of arm waving. SOOOOMUCH ARM WAVING!!! And very little breathing
\item make a list of “overhead” - make sure all concepts are well defined, in your notes, possibly in your slides
\item summary of what your many slides are — many different crunching of different data to circle around a process that we’re trying to under
\item insert heading slides, overall need a good deal more organization.
\item slide 1: break up into two or even 3?
\item Slide 2: Need to explain more generally what’s in the figure
\item Slide 3: climate simulation — is this method? If so, say so
\item Slide 4: ENSO and climate change slide — have “literature review” in heading.
\item slide about Mentor: do a better job explaining the interactive process between you and your mentor.
\item 3.4 index - whahah? I didn’t follow
\item Single forcing ensembles slide — not sure if all those arrows are working for you. Skip over single forcing setup, maybe?
\item use consistent language about the aerosols and their influence, considering that it’s a prediction
\end{itemize}
