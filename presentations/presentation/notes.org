** nowack 2017
*** Increase from CO2, decrease from 03
** lubbecke 2014
*** Higher number of weaker ENSO events from 2000-2010, caused by change in ocean heat distribution
**** not to be confused with climate change, 10 years is not enough
** zheng 2017
*** Large enough CESM gives increased ENSO
*** Darn internal variability

*** How to use wavelet analysis on ENSO
** emile 2007
*** Sunspots and orbital precession might have changed ENSO in the past
** zhu 2017
*** reduced CO2 during ice age may have led to weaker ENSO
** stevenson 2017
