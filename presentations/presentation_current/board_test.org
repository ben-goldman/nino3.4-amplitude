*** Introduction
**** What is El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO)?
- Drives extreme weather around the world
- Oscillation between warm and cold temperature in the Pacific Ocean
- Some events are more strong than others
- Significant effect on people: 2015-2016 event
- Major issue is prediction

**** Long-Term vs Short-Term Chang
- Long-term change: climate change/global warming
  + Causes: greenhouse gasses, aerosols (smoke), land use, etc.
- Short-term change: climate variability
  + ENSO, seasons, AMO (Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation), etc.

**** Review of literature
- citet:chen2017possible
  + Past studies disagree about whether ENSO will strengthen or weaken.
  + Simulation discrepancy caused by modeling of ENSO mechanics.
- citet:maher2018enso
  + Used a large dataset of climate predictions.
  + ENSO may become stronger in the future.
- citet:cai2018increased
  + Found that models agree by using a more flexible way of defining ENSO events
  + ENSO is strengthening because global warming is leading to higher stratification.

**** Research Goals
- Overall changes to ENSO amplitude
  + Estimate future changes to ENSO amplitude using the CESM1 dataset.
- Role of individual factors
  + Compare contributions of greenhouse gasses, aerosols, land use, biomass burning, and ozone to ENSO intensity.
- Changes to ocean structure
  + Examine changes to correlation coefficient between ENSO intensity and ocean temperature for each simulation.

**** Data: the CESM1 Large Ensemble
- Explore hypothetical scenarios with a computer model citet:kay2015community.
- Estimation of how the earth's climate actually works.
- Experimental group: Receives input of rising greenhouse gas and/or aerosol levels.
- Control group: Emissions fixed at levels before industrial revolution.

***** Niño 3.4 Variance
- How to calculate ENSO intensity in the model output?
- Step 1: Calculate sea temperature in Niño 3.4 region (5°N - 5°S, 120°-170°W) of tropical Pacific Ocean.
- Step 2: Convert temperature dataset to dataset representing change in temperature variation over time.
- Calculate variance around one point, move point forward slightly, repeat.

***** Butterfly Effect: The Need for a Large Ensemble
- Butterfly effect: Small differences in initial conditions can become big differences in end result citep:lorenz1963deterministic.
- Each simulation by itself is inaccurate.
- Repeat simulation with slightly different initial conditions.
- Due to larger sample size, noise can be filtered out by calculating the mean.

***** Model Predictions: ENSO in the Future
- Calculate mean and standard error of ENSO intensity in ensemble and control.
- ENSO is predicted to intensify in the 21st century!
- Statistically significant: exceeds 2 standard errors.
- Decreasing variance after 2060: still under investigation.

***** Analysis of Individual Factors
- Why is ENSO predicted to intensify? What human impacts play the largest role?
  + Factors include: Greenhouse gasses, aerosols, natural factors.
- Separate out individual influences in model output.
- Single forcing ensembles: forced by all factors except for 1.
- Subtract “all-but-one” ensembles from original “full-forcing” ensemble.
- Resulting data represents influence of only one factor.

***** Role of Greenhouse and Aerosol Emissions
- Greenhouse gasses and aerosols contribute to increase in variance.
- Aerosols and greenhouse gasses have same sign: disagree with previous studies citep:deser2020isolating.
- Greenhouse gasses and aerosols are both human-produced.

#+CAPTION: Influence of individual human factors. Yellow is greenhouse gasses, green is aerosols.

***** Correlation With Changes in Ocean Temperature
- Examine relationship between ocean temperature and ENSO intensity in each simulation.
- Calculate correlation coefficient between ENSO intensity and ocean temperature.
- Find correlation coefficient at each grid-point.

***** Physical Mediator: Heating Difference
- Strong negative correlation in fully forced ensemble below surface.
- Positive correlation in greenhouse ensemble and weak/zero correlation in aerosols ensemble
- Rising temperatures heat different layers of ocean at different rates, modifying heat transfer.

*** Conclusion and Discussion
- Predicted increase in variance
  + There is likely to be an increase in ENSO strength over the next 100 years. Agrees with citet:cai2018increased.
- Greenhouse gasses and aerosols
  + Increase is likely caused by the combined influence of greenhouse gasses and aerosols.
- Heat transfer
  + Global warming increases ENSO intensity by warming upper layers of the Pacific faster than central layers.
- Notable disagreement
  + Greenhouse gasses and aerosols both increase ENSO amplitude, in contrast to citet:deser2020isolating

*** Applications, Next Steps, Limitations
- Improve prediction ability to help people prepare for increased likelihood of extreme weather.
- Reduce danger by switching to renewable energy.
- Limitations:
  + Only used one climate model.
  + Niño 3.4 index may not be fully accurate for various models (Cai et. al. 2018).
- Next steps:
  + Work with other datasets, such as the new CESM2.
  + Examine other variables to further analyze mediator process.
