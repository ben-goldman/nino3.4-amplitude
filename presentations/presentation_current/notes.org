#+TITLE: Presentation Notes

* Outline

*** Climate Change
**** Only do long term change
**** examples
**** Forcing definition: outside influence that affects the earth's climate
**** Image: global warming trend line
*** El Niño
**** Figure with ocean and atmosphere mechanics
**** ENSO is when the temperature of the Pacific Ocean changes between different years
**** 2-8 year period
**** some events are stronger than others
**** We need to predict how it will change in the future
*** Climate simulation
**** Run equations that simulate climate on computers
**** take state of climate at one point and simulate it progressing
**** can be input with levels of forcing
**** output climate variables
*** Problem
**** will ENSO be stronger or weaker in the future?
**** Are we causing it?
*** Climate change and ENSO interact
**** cite:stevenson2017forced
***** Intertwining role of multiple forcings in affecting ENSO
**** cite:zheng2017response
***** ENSO's signal is highly clouded, only with a large (>15 models) ensemble can significant changes be detected.
**** cite:cai2018increased
***** When using EOF analysis and multiple models, signal strengthens
*** Gap and goal
*** CESM1 and CESM2, ensembles
*** R and Python tools
*** Role of mentor and student
*** Measuring ENSO - Niño 3.4
*** ENSO intensity - Windowed variance (or wavelets?)
*** Signal and noise
**** show an image of one member and ask for a trend
**** add other ensemble members to clarify and show importance of ensemble and sample size
*** Look at the figure? ENSO is becoming stronger
*** It's not that simple - chaos, need for an ensemble
*** Single forcing ensembles - data input setup
*** figure comparing - major factors are GHG and AER
*** What is causing this difference? Correlation with ocean temperature
*** look at TEMPDT correlations with FF ensemble - stratification is important

* Which articles to include?
*** cite:bjerknes1969atmospheric
**** Connected Walker Circulation to climate outside the Pacific
*** cite:torrence1998practical
**** Application of wavelet analysis to ENSO
**** Development of statistical significance tests for wavelet analysis
