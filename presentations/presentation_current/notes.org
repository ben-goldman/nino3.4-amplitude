#+TITLE: Presentation Notes

* Introduction

** El Nino
** Climate Change
** Chaos/Timeseries analysis
** Gap/rationale
** Hypothesis

* Materials, Methods, and Results
** Climate simulation
** CESM1 and CESM2, ensembles
** R and Python tools
** Role of mentor and student
** Measuring ENSO - Ni√±o 3.4
** ENSO intensity - Windowed variance (or wavelets?)
** Look at the figure? ENSO is becoming stronger
** It's not that simple - chaos, need for an ensemble
** Single forcing ensembles - data input setup
** bootstrap subtraction process
** figure comparing - major factors are GHG and AER
** What is causing this difference? Correlation with ocean temperature
** look at TEMPDT correlations with FF ensemble - stratification is important

* Discussion and Conclusion
