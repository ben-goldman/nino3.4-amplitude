#+TITLE: Presentation Notes


* Outline

*** Climate Change
**** Only do long term change
**** examples
**** Image: global warming trend line
*** El Niño
**** Figure with ocean and atmosphere mechanics
**** ENSO is when the temperature of the Pacific Ocean changes between different years
**** 2-8 year period
**** some events are stronger than others
**** We need to predict how it will change in the future
*** Gap and goal
*** Research Question
*** Climate simulation
*** Signal and noise
**** show an image of one member and ask for a trend
**** add other ensemble members to clarify and show importance of ensemble and sample size
*** CESM1 and CESM2, ensembles
*** R and Python tools
*** Role of mentor and student
*** Measuring ENSO - Niño 3.4
*** ENSO intensity - Windowed variance (or wavelets?)
*** Look at the figure? ENSO is becoming stronger
*** It's not that simple - chaos, need for an ensemble
*** Single forcing ensembles - data input setup
*** bootstrap subtraction process
*** figure comparing - major factors are GHG and AER
*** What is causing this difference? Correlation with ocean temperature
*** look at TEMPDT correlations with FF ensemble - stratification is important

* Which articles to include?
*** cite:bjerknes1969atmospheric
**** Connected Walker Circulation to climate outside the Pacific
*** cite:torrence1998practical
**** Application of wavelet analysis to ENSO
**** Development of statistical significance tests for wavelet analysis
*** cite:stevenson2017forced
**** Intertwining role of multiple factors in affecting ENSO
*** cite:cai2018increased
*** cite:zheng2017response
**** ENSO's signal is highly clouded, only with a large (>15 models) ensemble can significant changes be detected.
