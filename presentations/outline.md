# Presentation Outline

## Title slide

- Name and title
- Hook with major impacts of ENSO on everyday life
- ENSO will become stronger

## What is El Nino?

- Importance: extreme weather
- Basic overview of what happens:
  - Pacific ocean warms up, air currents change
  - Refer to figure
- Some years are more intense than others
- Prediction is important because it will help to prepare for extreme weather

## Short Vs. Long Term Change

- Why is weather different from climate: Timescale
- Introduce figure: global yearly average temperature
- Just like how weather is short term, there is also short term climate vs long term climate change
- ENSO is short term climate change, global warming is long term

## Review Of Literature

- At first people werent sure whether ENSO would intensify or weaken.
- By using a large group of simulations, people found that ENSO would likely strengthen, meaning more extreme weather
- using more advanced mathematical strategies, people were able to partially resolve disagreements in the data, showing that ENSO will most likely become stronger

## Research Goals

- ENSO can be dangerous, so we need to know how it will behave in the future.
- Researchers think that it will become stronger, but why is that happening?
- If we can figure out what human activities are contributing the most and why, then we can figure out what to do
- The next step is to determine why emissions cause ENSO to become stronger

## Data Source: Climate Model

- Recorded data does not allow researchers to explore hypothetical scenarios - like what if there were 4 times as much CO2 emissions?
- Computer model allows scientists to estimate how the earth's climate would react to different situations
- Especially useful because it enables prediction of what the climate will be like in the future!
- My setup predicts climate with business-as-usual emissions
- Most important part is to repeat the simulations over and over because each simulation may be inaccurate

## Methods step 1

- Goal: calculate future ENSO intensity from the model output
- Step 1: calculate sea temp. in tropical Pacific
- Convert temperature to change in temperature variation over time
- Windowing process

## Noise and the butterfly effect

- Butterfly effect happens in climate
- Cannot use only one simulation
- Graph: all 40 simulations, each doing something different
- Ensemble is when researchers run simulation repeatedly with slightly different initial conditions
- Find reliable trends when using average

## Model predictions: ENSO in the future

- Calculate mean and standard error of ensemble ENSO variance
- Same for control (grey bar)
- Graph shows predicted ENSO intensity until 2100!
- Increase: more extreme weather

## Analysis of individual factors

- So why is ENSO going to intensify? greenhouse gasses, aerosols, or something else?
- Define aerosols
- How to separate individual factors from model results?
- Researchers run model simulations forced by everything except one human/natural impact
- Example
- Then subtract the "full forcing" runs from them, leaving behind influence of only one factor.

## Influence of Greenhouse Gasses and Aerosols

- Greenhouse gasses and aerosol emissions both are working to intensify ENSO
- Disagrees with other studies
- Nonlinear/additive relationship between factors in comparison with full-forced ensemble
- Both greenhouse gasses and aerosols are human-produced: this is our fault!

## Ocean structure correlation methods

- We know that greenhouse gasses and aerosols are increasing ENSO intensity, but how?
- Is ENSO correlated with changes to ocean structure? Does this correlation vary in the individual factor ensembles?
- Use dataset with ocean temperature
- Correlate with ENSO variance
- Plot coefficient

# Results on ocean structure correlation

- Explain axes: x = longitude y = depth, color = correlation, plots are ensembles
- Strong negative correlation in fully forced ensemble below surface
- Positive correlation in ghg ensemble
- Weak/zero correlation in aer ensemble
- Difference means that forcing plays role
- Rising temperatures will heat different layers of ocean at different rates
- Not sure about interpretation other than that

# Conclusions/summary

- ENSO is likely to be more intense
- This is our fault, caused by greenhouse gasses and aerosols
- Happening because different layers of ocean heat at different rates

# Discussion

- Global warming means stronger ENSO
- ENSO intensification means more extreme weather
- Extreme weather kills people
- Reduce greenhouse emissions!
