** HOW TO USE:

- There are certain files with the extensions =.org= and =.md=. These files are used to create the =.pdf= files that have the same file name. They will have the same content but slightly different formatting compared to their =.pdf= files. They will also open more easily online and are much smaller in size. If you see a =.org= file with the same name as another file, it is usually easier to view the =.org= because it will not have to be downloaded.
- Files with the =.bbl= and =.out= files are used as support files, and they may be unreadable.
- =.pdf=, =.md=, and =.org= files can all be read online, in the browser window.
- Other files, like Microsoft Office documents (=.docx=, =.pptx=, =.xlsx=) will have to be downloaded following the instructions below.
- Finally, files with the extensions =.odt= and =.odp= can be opened in Word and PowerPoint, respectively.

*** Generally, most of my documents are in =.pdf= form.

*** Files named =readme.md= or =readme.org= are summary/explanation for certain folders, or they contain an online-viewable copy of that folder's content.

Navigate repository on website and download files individually as needed.

- Navigate by clicking on folder links at top
- Certain files cannot be viewed online, click "View Raw" to download and open offline.
